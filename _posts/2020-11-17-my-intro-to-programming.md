It's intermission week after an intense 6-week introduction to software engineering at <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School</a>. Mod 1—the first of four modules that make up the 7-month backend engineering program—was a deep-dive introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Ruby.

### Mod 1 Projects
Below are the projects I worked on during Mod 1. Follow the links to check out the repos on GitHub.

__Week 6 - <a href="https://github.com/philmccarthy/night_writer" target="_blank">Night Writer</a>__: A Ruby program which encodes & decodes braille.

__Week 4-5 - <a href="https://github.com/philmccarthy/futbol" target="_blank">Futbol</a>__: Data Access Layer and Object Relationship Mapping exploration using data from a fictional soccer league to analyze statistics. This project was a precursor to our introduction to Ruby on Rails & ActiveRecord. We were tasked with understanding & building basic database functions that will be abstracted by AR when we dive into ROR next mod.

__Week 2-3 - <a href="https://github.com/philmccarthy/battleship" target="_blank">Battleship</a>__: Command-line playable program in the style of the popular boardgame Battleship. <a href="https://repl.it/@philmccarthy/battleship#README.md" target="_blank">Play Battleship on repl.it!</a>

__Week 1 - <a href="https://github.com/philmccarthy/flash_cards" target="_blank">Flash Cards</a>__: Quiz-like command-line game which emulates flash cards.

### Mastery Skills
I'm proud to have come out of the first quarter with a solid programming foundation to build on:

__Ruby Mechanics__
  - Use & manipulate Ruby's primary data types, with particular focus on hashes in the second half of the module
  - Use enumarables to iterate over collections (especially nested ones)
  - Manage programs with flow control structures and boolean expressions
  - Use methods (functions), arguments and return values to write logical code
  - Create classes that use instance variables, attribute readers, and instance methods
  - Understand inheritance through superclasses and modules
  - Import/export data from/to files
  - Write class methods

__Design__
- Understand state & behavior
- Breakdown large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks of functionality (whiteboarding, psuedocoding)
- Follow a Test Driven Development workflow
- Understand & implement single responsibility and 'don't repeat yourself' principles
- Write readable code with descriptive variable names, succinct methods & lines of code
- Adhere to a project directory convention

__Testing__
- Identify what to test for to verify a program's expected behavior
- Implement unit & integration testing of all functionality in a program using Minitest
- Translate technical specs into tests
- Write tests before implementation code
- Implement mocks & stubs in testing
- Track test coverage (simplecov) and consistently achieve 100% LOC coverage on team & solo projects

__Debugging__
- Diagnose & fix bugs
- Recognize & explain common Ruby error messages
- Use Pry to create breakpoints in code
- Identify when variables are in/out of scope

__Version Control__
- Interact with Git and GitHub local & remote repos from the command line
- Commit code in small chunks of functionality
- Submit & merge PRs on GitHub
- Collaborate on project repos with a partner & in a larger group and resolve merge conflicts

### On to Mod 2

Mod 2 kicks off on November 30. The next quarter will focus on gaining mastery in backend web app development using the Ruby on Rails framework. Two other focus areas of the Mod 2 curriculum are database management and testing & debugging. 

One thing to note that attracted me to Turing over other immersive programs is its non-profit status. Plus, its curriculum is completely open source. <a href="https://backend.turing.io/module2/" target="_blank">Check the Mod 2 curriculum out</a> if you'd like!
