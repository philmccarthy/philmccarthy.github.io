I'm offically halfway done with [Turing's](https://turing.io) backend engineering program. I've been intensely studying Ruby, object-oriented programming since August, and now Rails since mid-November.

Looking back to the start the Mod 2 (the second quarter of Turing's 4-Mod program), I was overwhelmed by the scope of a simple Rails project coming from Ruby-only builds. Eight weeks later, I have a solid understanding of web development technologies:

- Model, View, Controller (MVC) design patterns
- HTTP request/response cycle
- ReSTful programming
- Designing database-backed applications — PostgreSQL & SQL
- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) — ActiveRecord Models & Query Interface
- TDD in a Rails environment (model & feature testing)
- Heroku deployment
- API calls & JSON parsing
- Git & GitHub collaboration with multiple devs
- CSS frameworks

The next half of the curriculum will continue to challenge my Ruby on Rails knowledge while going much deeper into creating and consuming APIs.

The Mod 3 curriculum will challenge me in these areas:

- Object Oriented Programming
  - make abstractions to improve code quality
  - develop classes to encapsulate data
  - apply MVC principles in Single Responsibility context
- APIs
  - expose and test an internal API
  - consume and test external APIs
  - use serializers to format JSON responses
  - authenticate users with OAuth & access private resources
- Develop legit web applications
  - work on teams of 4-10 developers with project managers
  - understand and build on existing code bases
  - implement code reviews to improve quality
- Testing
  - mock HTTP requests using Webmock & VCR
- Databases
  - compose advanced SQL and ActiveRecord queries
- Optimization
  - explore caching strategies to improve performance
  - implement background workers in Rails
  - recognize and avoid n+1 queries
- Javascript
  - begin exploring JS
  - make API calls using `fetch`
  - use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM)

Up to this point, I've invested approximately 800 hours into my studies at Turing. The days, weeks, and months are long but fulfilling. I feel like I've learned more than I can fully comprehend from a technical standpoint.

But I've also had the chance to meet and work with amazing humans. Being a member of the diverse, progressive Turing community has pushed me to check my unconscious bias and hone my active listening skills.

As a student leadership rep for my cohort, I'm taking an active role in building our community's culture by leading retros, making space for everyone's voice to be heard, and executing on takeaways from the team.

Here's to the next chapter!
