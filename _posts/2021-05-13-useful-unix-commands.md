I recently began going through Michael Hartl's Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous course, and I'm using this post to keep notes about useful Unix commands. I'm actively updating this post as I work through the course!

### Editing the line

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Display manual page for command | `man <command>` |
| Cursor to beginning of line | `^A` |
| Cursor to end of line | `^E` |
| Clear to beginning of line | `^U` |
| Cursor to mouse | `option + click` |
| Scroll output out of view | `^L` |
| Exit terminal | `^D` |

More to come!
