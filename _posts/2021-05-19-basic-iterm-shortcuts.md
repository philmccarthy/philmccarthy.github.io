I recently switched to using the iTerm2 terminal emulator on my Mac. With [Shell Integration](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) enabled, I discovered a few helpful features that I wanted to document. It sent me down a rabbit hole, and I started this post to keep notes about iTerm features I want to build into my workflow.

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
Navigate to previous shell prompts or other locations of interest | `cmd + shift + up/down`
Open command history popup | `shift + cmd + ;`
Autocomplete | `cmd + ;`
Open recent directories popup | `cmd + opt + /`
Enter [copy mode](https://iterm2.com/documentation-copymode.html) | `shift + arrow`
Exit copy mode | `esc` or `q`
Select word | `double click`
Select entire line | `triple click`
Open a split pane terminal horizontally | `cmd + d`
Open a split pane terminal vertically | `cmd + shift + d`
Expand current pane (and revert) | `cmd + shift + enter`
Navigate split panes | `cmd + opt + arrow`
Open copy/paste history | `cmd + shift + h`

These are fairly basic commands to get started with iTerm, but there's a boat load of additional useful features. Check out [iTerm's documentation](https://iterm2.com/documentation.html) to join me down the rabbit hole.
