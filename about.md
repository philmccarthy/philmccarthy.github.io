My name's Phil McCarthy and I'm a software engineer at VIZIO, currently focused on QA Automation. I write Python, JavaScript, and Ruby code. I also work part-time at Turing School as a teaching assistant and prospective student interviewer, helping to form the on ramp to tech for career changers like myself.

Before I made the decision to dedicate my career to software development, I spent 8 years as an editor, copywriter, and marketer in the golf world. To boot, I played professional golf as a member of the PGA of America.

My golf skills never led me to making the big bucks you might see folks make on TV, but pursuing a dream from my teenage years was a blast. Toward the end of my career in golf, I realized that working in the industry and playing professionally had led me to get burned out on the game.

What started as a passionate hobby had become a stress inducing pursuit. It was the opposite of what attracted me to golf in the first place: a quiet escape from the everyday hustle.

In August of 2020, I resigned my PGA membership and applied to reinstate my amateur status. And with transition upon me, I signed up for the backend software engineering program at <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School</a>.

It was one of the best decisions of my life.

I live in Denver with my partner Alexine. Outside of programming and playing golf, you might find me brewing a good cup of coffee, home chefing, or learning to ski.
