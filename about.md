My name's Phil McCarthy and I'm a software developer.

Before I made the decision to dedicate my career to software development, I spent 8 years as an editor, copywriter, and marketer in the golf world. To boot, I played professional golf as a member of the PGA of America.

My golf skills never led me to making the big bucks you might see folks make on TV, but pursuing a dream from my teenage years was a blast. Toward the end of my career in golf, I realized that working in the industry and playing professionally had led me to get burned out on the game.

What started as a passionate hobby had become a stress inducing pursuit. It was the opposite of what attracted me to golf in the first place: a quiet escape from the everyday hustle.

In August of 2020, I resigned my PGA membership and applied to reinstate my amateur status. And with transition upon me, I signed up for the backend software engineering program at <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School</a> that kicked off that October.

I've always been passionate about computers and technology. I'm drawn to the endless learning inherent to computer programming. Plus, I find the serotonin spike of solving a coding problem akin to making a hole-in-one in a golf tournament.

Along my new path, the vision I have for my career is to work on a team that cares about its people and the people they program for. I want to contribute positively to society, and build software that makes a felt difference in my community. I will prioritize working for an organization that is outspoken about social & climate justice, supports work-life balance, and rewards its employees—money-wise & otherwise—for doing good, caring, deep work.
